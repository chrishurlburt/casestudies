The resident/ activist who chose to file a lawsuit against the owner is creating a scheduling problem. This case is interesting, however, because the resident was not in the wrong for attempting to create a more efficient landscape for the community, that individual just wanted what was best for the project. Perhaps the wrong methods, but nevertheless. If the owner or architect truly wanted the impervious pavement for a project located on a flood plain, it can be argued that they may have overlooked a drainage factor during the design stages of the project. Or perhaps the impervious pavement had other qualities, such as high workability, superior durability, extreme strength, or just a familiar product that the designers knew worked well. These are factors unknown to the author, but important to think about. What the contractor could have done is this; review the project a little more in depth. Had the contractor noted the discrepancy between location and material choice, chosen to investigate a little deeper, and started a dialogue with the owner, for example:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;\"Are there any other alternates to this impervious pavement? If proper drainage is crucial to this project shouldn\'t we look into a more suitable material?\"&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There is a possibility that this matter could have been avoided all together. The owner would have impressed, as well as appreciative of the fact that the contractor cared enough about the project to attempt to make it more successful.</span>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a result of the lawsuit, the material order, and the change order, the schedule was delayed by two months. The contractor had to work late nights and weekends, but he/ she provided a solution that was a win-win for all parties involved. Multiple subcontractors were pulled onto the job site during construction to work around the issue. The scheduled was delayed and some work had to be completed in not ideal situations, but the work was completed satisfactorily. The owner, contractor, activist, and the environment are all pleased.</span></p>','We are performing a project for a hospital, and the project is located on a flood plain.&nbsp; The Civil/Site Engineer incorporated massive underground surge tanks and infiltration champers in the design to capture water from heavy rains and snow melts, and subsequently disperse the water slowly back to the watershed in order to mitigate against the flooding that occurs during these events.&nbsp; The town Conservation Commission has reviewed and approved the project design subject to compliance ...','no','no',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'case-1-untitled',1,1,NULL,'2016-04-11 15:58:51','2016-04-11 16:01:11'),(3,'Case 2','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">While performing a pre-trench excavation for a slurry wall foundation, which is a technique used to build reinforced concrete walls in areas of soft earth, our team encountered soil which showed evidence of a petroleum leak from a previously unknown underground storage tank.</span></p>','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There was no feasible alternative to keep work going and productivity up, so work was stopped.

Which in construction, is almost common tradition. Along those lines, it is never a good thing for there to be a show-stopping event, but that does not mean that all is lost and the project will run over budget and over schedule. Potential mistakes and setbacks are typically accounted for during the estimating process. A construction manager\'s quick, effective, and positive response and attitude towards any given problematic situation is just as crucial to the project as is the situation itself. Being a responsible construction entity will ensure that the other parties of the contract, the owners, the subcontractors, and the advising companies, that their work, money, and time is in the hands of the right individual. This results not only in a favorable reputation for the future, but also compliance with future requests.</span></p>','&nbsp;\r\nWhile performing a pre-trench excavation for a slurry wall foundation, which is a technique used to build reinforced concrete walls in areas of soft earth, our team encountered soil which showed evidence of a petroleum leak from a previously unknown underground storage tank....','no','no',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'case-2',1,1,NULL,'2016-04-11 16:00:49','2016-04-11 16:00:49'),(4,'Case 3','<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">We had limited room for mobilizing our workforce on a tight construction site in Boston.</span></p>','<p>&nbsp;<span class=\"s1\">We had the structural engineer redesign the steel at street level in order to accommodate the truck loading.

Even the simplest of buildings can become a logistical nightmare when there is a lack of space to mobilize the project. When one is faced with an issue such as this, it can prove to be quite costly in terms of time and money if the situation is not dealt with in the appropriate fashion. This case is a perfect example of how one might overcome the limitations set by a congested jobsite. Not every issue can be solved by the construction manager alone. More often than not, the CM will find it beneficial to consult their subcontractor, design team, and even owners in regards to more specialized issues. In this particular instance, the mobilization was significantly facilitated as a result of assistance from the project&rsquo;s structural subcontractor.&nbsp;</span></p>','&nbsp;We had limited room for mobilizing our workforce on a tight construction site in Boston....','no','no',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'case-3',1,1,NULL,'2016-04-11 16:02:24','2016-04-11 16:02:41'),(5,'Case 4','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We were managing a build out of a graduate dormitory with three floors of underground parking.&nbsp; Upon reaching the bottom of the excavation, we encountered a tremendous amount of rainfall within a two to three day period.

It was an extremely dangerous situation and to make matters worse, the pumps that we had been using for dewatering, were shut down by the city and state so that they could try and get ahead of flood situations in other areas.&nbsp;</span></p>','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Since the site was underwater and we were at the mercy of the city officials, the site was effectively shut down.&nbsp; We kept essential personnel on site and worked with city officials in order to figure out where we could pump our water to. Ultimately, we were allowed to pump though our sediment tanks and divert the water into a nearby river. Despite the fact that the river was running high, we were allowed to continue seeing as there were officials monitoring the flow of the river. Our efforts with filters and sediment tank were not perfect; plumes would emerge in the river occasionally. Once we were allowed to pump, we monitored the site for 24 hours and within approximately two days; we were back up and running.</span></p>','<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">One of the hardest factors to take into consideration when planning a project is the influence that the weather/environment will have on the safety and feasibility of the project. While it is possible for one to look at historical weather data in an attempt to predict the occurrence of adverse weather, there is no way for anyone to estimate the exact time or day these events may take place.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;If and when a construction manager encounters a situation where a natural event causes an unavoidable delay, it is absolutely crucial that they maintain a calm and collected approach to resolving the issue at hand.

At the same time, we let the concrete subcontractor work on what they believed to be the correct solution. The price of the alternative recommended by the architect and the threat of a backcharge convinced the concrete subcontractor to utilize their best finishers. Ultimately, they ended up spending less than they could have and the owner and architect were satisfied with both our efforts to correct the problem and the subcontractor&rsquo;s efforts to resolve the issue at hand.</span></p>','<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">As a construction manager on a jobsite, it is of upmost importance that one ensures that the work being completed by the contractors and subcontractors meets the standards that are set by the owner and the architect/engineer.

However, there is always the possibility for the exact opposite to occur and for disputes to develop between the involved parties.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">When faced with the issue of subpar quality of work completed, it can be quite difficult to resolve the associated issues regarding additional costs and scheduling delays. It is important to consult the project&rsquo;s design plans and specifications in order to determine who is responsible for the excess costs and delays. At the same time, the construction manager should be coordinating with the owner and architect to develop a plan to resolve any issues that are remaining.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Through this conflict resolution process, it is possible that the owner realizes that the cost for correcting the errors prove to be greater than the value of the error.</span></p>','&nbsp;\r\nWe had a significantly sized area of exposed cast-in-place concrete that was supposed to have an \'architectural\' finish on it.

Due to this volatility of the minimum requirements for buildings, it can be quite tricky at times to design an entire project before an amendment to the building codes. It is not entirely uncommon for the designer of a building to plan to surpass requirements detailed in the building codes in order to compensate for future changes.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;When faced with an issue regarding changes to a plan that are necessary due to more stringent codes it is often quite difficult to resolve these issues without creating additional costs or potential delays to the project&rsquo;s overall schedule.

The issue required further study and analysis which forced us to stop our work.</span></p>','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We conducted extensive exploratory work of the existing masonry facade (which should have been done by the designer before they started designing) and tested parts of the existing masonry system (brick compression, mortar composition, etc.).&nbsp; The project team (Owner, Architect, Engineer, and Construction Manager) held numerous meetings in order to review the information and discuss the different approaches to solve the issue at hand.&nbsp; Eventually, the structural engineer recommended that we install 5,000 &frac34; inch by 24 inch Hilti masonry anchors with 2-part adhesive and 4 inch reinforced masonry block for back up in order to make the existing facade more secure.</span></p>','','&nbsp;\r\nWe signed a contract to partially demolish a 100 year old high school. The contract detailed that we would have to preserve the existing masonry facade and incorporate it into the new construction of a 150,000 square foot Data Center.&nbsp; The design documents that we bid the demolition work off of indicated that the wall system consisted of several wythes thick of brick in a solid configuration.

Project superintendents are especially important for these projects, particularly those who take the time to get to know the entire job. Specifically, it proves to be largely beneficial for the superintendent to determine where the risks are and to even create a sequenced plan regarding the execution of the work. The last thing you want to have is a superintendent who does not know the job or who joins the project team late. When the project&rsquo;s buyout was completed and the summer work was about to begin, the project superintendent, who planned out the entire job personally, resigned from the company.</span></p>','<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The company immediately brought in a replacement superintendent whose resume indicated that they had previously worked a number of fast paced school projects. Due to the fact that he lived approximately 2 hours away from the jobsite, I, as an intern, took charge for much of the weekend and after hours work. For the first month on the job, I worked side by side with the new superintendent for approximately 70 hours per week. We held daily meetings with key foreman in order to determine where work was available. Additionally, it proved to be important for all of us to keep the communication lines open. The job became a living, breathing creature, with changes and decisions made as they became relevant, rather than the meticulous plan that had been laid out by the previous superintendent. Through effective communication and more than a few double shifts, the school opened on time and we maintained our budget, turning over a profitable project.</span></p>','','&nbsp;\r\nThe company I work for was awarded a project to work on a school and was to be completed over the course of a single summer.&nbsp; Typically, these types of projects are fast paced in nature and consequentially, months of detailed planning by a project team are necessary seeing as nearly every activity is considered to be on the critical path of the schedule.

We told them that they had been falling behind lately and we wanted to work closely with them to get the project back on track. We also told them that if things did not improve over the next 2-3 weeks, we would look into utilizing the options available to us in the terms and conditions of our contract. We then set up &ldquo;micro schedules&rdquo; for them to follow and constantly documented their progress or lack of progress as the case may be. Once it became clear that the contractor could not meet their contractual obligations, we contacted the bonding agency and ultimately, had the contractor replaced.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">We were able to have this done due to the fact that when we first noticed that there was a potential issue; we immediately notified the contractor and issued a formal letter that described the issue in detail. Next, we followed up with one-on-one focus meetings to address schedule and sequence moves. We provided detailed meeting minutes and status updates that were relative to the scheduling commitments that they agreed upon during the focus meetings. As a result, when we decided to get the bonding agency involved, we were in a perfect position seeing as we had detailed documents that served to explain the contractor&rsquo;s failure to maintain the schedule. In addition, the videos and photos that we had taken so as to record the actual work completed prior to each meeting proved to be invaluable in the replacement process. Once the bonding agency reviewed our detailed information, they had no choice but to pay for the removal of this contractor and all of the costs associated with accelerating the schedule to compensate for the delays.</span></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">The lesson here, is that as a Construction Manager, we first need to attempt to help the contractor through their issues. As this is being done, it is crucial to constantly document as much as possible in as high a detail feasible. This documentation should be given to the contractor so they are aware of what you are doing. If the issues are still not resolved after this you will be able to rest easy since you will be in a perfect position to have them replaced without it costing your company any additional expenses through the consultation of the bonding agency. If we had not done our due diligence, it would have cost us a great deal of time and money. Not to mention the fact the Owner would lose their confidence in our ability to meet the predetermined schedule(s).</span></p>','','&nbsp;\r\nWe were awarded a project to build a surgery center for a client located in Connecticut.
